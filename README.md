First we will train the model on raw data, and we will use Feature Selection technique to highlight some of the features and train on selected features. Hence, we will compare the models and accuracy.

## Our Plan

<b> 1. Observe Dataset </b>

<b> 2. Exploratory Data Analysis </b>

<b> 3. Datset Cleaning </b>
  - Check for data imbalance
 
<b> 4. Data Preprocessing </b>
  - Split Training and testing
  - Feature Selection with RandomForest
  - PCA
  
<b> 5. Models, Hyperparameter Tuning, Cross Validation and Model Evaluation </b>

  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbor
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
